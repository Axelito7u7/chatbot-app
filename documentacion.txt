You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  C:\Users\Wendy\Desktop\nombre-del-proyecto

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are initializing within an existing Firebase project directory

? Are you ready to proceed? Yes
? Which Firebase features do you want to set up for this directory? Press Space to select features, then Enter to confirm your   
choices. Firestore: Configure security rules and indexes files for Firestore, Functions: Configure a Cloud Functions directory   
and its files, Hosting: Configure files for Firebase Hosting and (optionally) set up GitHub Action deploys, Storage: Configure a 
security rules file for Cloud Storage

=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

i  Using project chatbot-d9174 (chatbot)

=== Firestore Setup

Firestore Security Rules allow you to define how and when to allow
requests. You can keep these rules in your project directory
and publish them with firebase deploy.

? What file should be used for Firestore Rules? firestore.rules

Firestore indexes allow you to perform complex queries while
maintaining performance that scales with the size of the result
set. You can keep index definitions in your project directory
and publish them with firebase deploy.

? What file should be used for Firestore indexes? firestore.indexes.json
? File firestore.indexes.json already exists. Do you want to overwrite it with the Firestore Indexes from the Firebase Console? 
Yes

=== Functions Setup

Detected existing codebase(s): default

? Would you like to initialize a new codebase, or overwrite an existing one? Overwrite

Overwriting codebase default...

? What language would you like to use to write Cloud Functions? JavaScript
? Do you want to use ESLint to catch probable bugs and enforce style? No
+  Wrote functions/package.json
+  Wrote functions/index.js
+  Wrote functions/.gitignore
? Do you want to install dependencies with npm now? Yes
npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.
npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported

=== Hosting Setup

Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

? What do you want to use as your public directory? public
? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes
? Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? No
? File public/index.html already exists. Overwrite? No
i  Skipping write of public/index.html

=== Storage Setup

Firebase Storage Security Rules allow you to define how and when to allow
uploads and downloads. You can keep these rules in your project directory
and publish them with firebase deploy.

? What file should be used for Storage Rules? storage.rules
+  Wrote storage.rules

PS C:\Users\Wendy\Desktop\nombre-del-proyecto> npm run build

> react-scripts build

Creating an optimized production build...
One of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it may break at any time.

babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, which
is not maintianed anymore. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
go away.

The project was built assuming it is hosted at /.
You can control this with the homepage field in your package.json.

The build folder is ready to be deployed.
You may serve it with a static server:

  serve -s build

Antes de copilar el firebase deploy tenemos que cambiar el firebase.json 

 "hosting": 
    "public": "public", debemos cambiarlo a build 
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],

 "hosting": 
    "public": "build", Asi debe de quedar
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],

If you are renaming a function or changing its region, it is recommended that you create the new function first before deleting the old one to prevent event loss. For more info, visit https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/manage-functions#modify

En este paso empezamos a crear funciones simples las cuales llamamos al dialgflow las funciones estan en functions/index.js

cuando terminamos de editar un funcion se van a cd functions para estar dentro de esta carpeta y solo usan el comando

firebase deploy 
firebase deploy --only functions
